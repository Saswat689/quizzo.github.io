# Quizzo the ultimate quiz game

Quizzo was made by Saswat a 13 year old kid who loves coding. Me! So hey everyone let me introduce you to this amazing open sourced quiz app.

## Demo

Before i discuss with you the features of the application be sure to check the demo. [Quizzo](https://saswat689.github.io/quizzo.github.io/)

## Screenshots

I know some of you are lazy to see the live demo of it. Here are some examples from the app but again you will not get that feel so be sure to check out the demo.

## Features of the application

* **Assistant bot:** 
  As soon as you open the application it shows you a bot who guides you about some of the basic functions of the application.
  
* **Add your own questions:**
  Probably one of the best features of quizzo. Add questions to the list and play with them later.
  
* **Different colour schemes:**
  A large variety of colour schemes are used to create the UI/UX with the concept of human emotions in mind.
  
* **Animations:**
  A number of animations including gif's are used to enhance UX. For example once you finish the quiz you get a coins rain.
  
  Lastly this appplication was built for a hackathon that [Codingal](https://www.codingal.com/) provided. I like to thank them for giving me this opportunity.
